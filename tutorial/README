PRELIMINARY REMARKS:
1)
This dummy tutorial is meant to show how to run the RNAmapping pipeline at very basic level.
The goal is mapping 5 RNAs sequences to 2 nematode genomes.

2)
This tutorial provides you an input forder with:
	-The nematode compressed genomes  
	-A multi-FASTA file with the 5 RNA queries

3)
The pipeline supports WU-Blast and AB-Blast based mapping strategies. 
In order to run command lines here reported for the dummyTutorial the user must have installed the following programs:
	-WU-Blast
	-exonerate
	-chr_subseq


PROCEDURE:
#Decompressing the target genomes
	cd dummyTutorial/input
	gunzip *.gz


#create the "genomes" file
#edit the file so that it contains two lines, one for genomes. Each line have this syntax:  PATH/dummyTutorial/input/nematodeGenomeFile  nematodeName
#for example:
#/users/cn/gbussotti/Desktop/RNAmappingPipeLine/dummyTutorial/input/c_elegans.WS227.genomic_softmasked.fa    c_elegans
#/users/cn/gbussotti/Desktop/RNAmappingPipeLine/dummyTutorial/input/c_briggsae.WS227.genomic_softmasked.fa   c_briggsae
	cd RNAmappingPipeLine_V0.3
	touch genomes
	emacs genomes


#Define the experiment and the mapping conditions with startPipeline.pl
#It is possible to show all the startPipeline.pl parameters by doing ./startPipeline.pl
##WARNING## Make sure that on your computer you call exonerate just by typing "exonerate", wu-blastn by typing "wu-blastn", xdformat by typing "xdformat", and chr_subseq by typing "chr_subseq"
# if this is not the case it is possible to redifine it by using the following startPipeline.pl parameters: 
#-exonerate   otherName
#-blast       otherName
#-xdformat    otherName
#-chr_subseq  otherName
	./startPipeline.pl -genomes genomes -experiment test -blast_strategy wublastn -query ../input/5_RNA_queries.fa


#Run the pipeline
	./executePipeline.pl -experiment test -pipeline_dir .




OUTPUT:
You can find both the blast and exonerate outputs in experiments/test.
